The steps for the project were as follows: 

Step 1: Obtained raw data files from The Observatory of Economic Complexity and UN Comtrade Database 

Step 2: Analyzed data using the pandas library in Python, to determine features and target variables  

Step 3: Uploaded CSV files to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
