This project includes data from the United Nations International Trade Statistics Database, Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Statistics Division (UN Comtrade), as well as The Observatory of Economic Complexity. The questions proposed for this project were the following: 

  1. Which countries have the highest import of the given item? 
  2. Which countries have the highest export of the given item?
  3. Comparison between items: which item is exported the most? 

The steps for the project were as follows: 

Step 1: Gathered raw data files from The Observatory of Economic Complexity and UN Comtrade Database 

Step 2: Searched data for Women's/Girls Clothing, which is organized by type of clothing and material used

Step 3: Extracted Women's/Girls Clothing items, by ID number, and material types for Cotton and Wool/Fine Animal Hair in the following categories:
